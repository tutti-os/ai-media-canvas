# Sample Prompts

These prompt recipes are starting points for `generate_image`. They are intentionally complete prompt recipes, not the default amount of augmentation to add to every user request.

When adapting a user's prompt:

- keep user-provided requirements
- only add detail according to the specificity policy in `SKILL.md`
- do not treat every example below as permission to invent extra story elements

The labeled lines are prompt scaffolding, not a closed schema. `Asset type` and `Input images` are prompt-only scaffolding.

For prompting principles, see `references/prompting.md`.
